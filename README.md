# Program and Literature List
## Subject Competition in Informatics "LOGIA" for Students of Grades IV–VIII of Primary Schools in the Mazowieckie Province, School Year 2024/2025

### Main Objectives:
- Understanding, analyzing, and solving problems through logical, abstract, and algorithmic thinking.
- Implementing algorithmic tasks in the Python programming language.

### Stages:
- **Stage 1:** Graphics and computations.
- **Stage 2:** Graphics and computations, text processing, and single-level lists.
- **Stage 3:** Graphics and computations, text processing, and multi-level lists.

### Skills and Knowledge Areas:
- Operating computers, digital devices, and computer networks, including:
  - Representation of information.
  - Functioning of digital devices and computer networks.
  - Performing calculations and writing programs.
- Creating with computers: drawings, designs, texts, animations, multimedia presentations, and numeric data.
- Communication using computers and ICT.
- Observing laws and safety rules:
  - Privacy and data protection.
  - Intellectual property rights.
  - Communication etiquette and social norms.
  - Evaluating and mitigating technological risks.

### Specific Requirements:
- Basic Python constructs and turtle graphics commands.
- Input/output instructions, arithmetic and logical operations, assignment, conditional statements, loops (fixed and conditional), variables, strings, lists (Stage 2 and 3), and other data structures.
- Defining custom functions and using built-in functions (e.g., square root), including recursion.
- Problem-solving steps: analyzing the problem, developing an algorithm, implementing it, and testing; breaking problems into subproblems.
- Using mathematical knowledge:
  - Squares and their diagonals, equilateral triangles and heights, other polygons.
  - Dividing angles into equal parts.
  - Scaling drawings, finding similar elements.
- Representing numbers, strings, and images in computers.
- Encoding images with numbers, strings, and lists.
- Basic number algorithms:
  - Divisibility, primality, Euclid’s algorithm (GCD, LCM), number properties.
- Text processing by specific rules: palindromes, anagrams, permutations, and combinations.
- Searching in ordered and unordered sets, counting elements, finding minima and maxima, and sorting.
- Topics related to encryption (various cipher types).
- Examining relations between elements: tree and graph structures; labyrinth tasks.
- Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.
- Non-decimal number systems: conversions between systems.
- Using randomness in problem-solving.
- Algorithm evaluation: time complexity.
- Testing solutions for task-compliant parameters.
- Using built-in help/documentation.
